**MULTITESEO EATER AGENT**

`National University of Colombia - Introduction to the intelligent systems 2017-I`


This repository uses the code from [here](https://github.com/jgomezpe/unalcol) as framework for the development of two 
game agents, the first one consists of an agent who must find an exit inside a labyrinth without knowing anything about
it from the start, it uses a uniform search to find the nearest unexplored cell in the maze. The second agent plays
Connect four using a mini-max search under a streak counting heuristic along with alpha beta pruning.

The following files were added to the original project and contains the code we designed for the agents:

`/agents/src/unalcol/agents/examples/labyrinth/multeseo/eater/ISI2017I/hackermen`

`/agents/src/unalcol/agents/examples/games/fourinrow/ISI2017I/hackermen`

to run each game respectively use the files `FourinRowMain` under `/agents/src/unalcol/agents/examples/games/fourinrow/`

or `MultiTeseoEaterLabyrinth` under `/agents/src/unalcol/agents/examples/labyrinth/multeseo/eater/`.
